Standalone implementation of computational primitives for deep signal processing model architectures. For training, please refer to the [savanna](https://github.com/Zymrael/savanna/) project.

### In Docker environment

To run 40b generation sample, simply execute:

```bash
./run
```

To run 7b generation sample, simply execute:

```bash
sz=7 ./run
```

To run tests:

```bash
./run ./run_tests
```

To interactively execute commands in docker environment:

```bash
./run bash
```

### Without Docker

#### Environment setup (uv)

```bash
make setup
```

To make sure you are using the right uv environment, run `source .venv/bin/activate`

#### Run generation script
=======
## Interface

While installation of the a `vortex`-specific environment is recommended for generation with `vortex`, we also provide an interface for using the primitives with a lightweight installation process:

## Environment setup (uv)

To run e2e installation in a uv environment, use the following command:
```bash
make setup
```
Note that the `setup` step will compile various CUDA kernels, which usually takes at most several minutes. It may be necessary to customize CUDA header and library paths in `Makefile`.  

After installation, use 
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```
to activate the environment.

## Environment setup (conda)

Manually follow the `make setup` steps in your preferred conda environment.

## Environment setup (docker)

TODO

## Quickstart
>>>>>>> origin/main

```bash
python3 generate.py \
    --config_path <PATH_TO_CONFIG> \
    --checkpoint_path <PATH_TO_CHECKPOINT> \
    --input_file <PATH_TO_INPUT_FILE> \
    --cached_generation
```
<<<<<<< HEAD

The flag `--cached_generation` is optional, but recommended for faster generation.
=======
`--cached_generation` turns on KV-caching and custom caching for different variants of Hyena layers.
